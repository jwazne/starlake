## Incremental Load

Starlake support two types of incremental load: `append` and `upsert`.

In append mode, Starlake will only append new data to the table. In upsert mode, Starlake will update the existing data and append new data to the table.

### Append

```yaml {11}
---
table:
  metadata:
    writeStrategy:
        type: "APPEND" # When set to append, Starlake will only append new data to the table.
  name: "customers"
  pattern: "customers.*.psv"
  attributes:
  - ...
```

### Upsert
We will distinguish here partitioned and non partitioned tables.

For non partitioned tables, upsert is done by using the `writeStrategy` key in the table configuration. The `writeStrategy` key is a dictionary with three attributes: `type`, `key` and `timestamp`.
- the `type` key is used to specify the write strategy. It can be set to `APPEND`, `OVERWRITE`, `UPSERT_BY_KEY`, `UPSERT_BY_AND_TIMESTAMP` or `SCD2`.
- The `key` key is used to specify the column(s) that will be used to identify a row.
- The `timestamp` key is used to specify the column that will be used to determine the latest version of a row.

When `timestamp`is not specified, any existing row with the same `key` will be overwritten.
When `timestamp` is defined, the most recent version of a row will be kept. The rows are sorted by the column referenced by the `timestamp` attribute in descending order.

```yaml
---
table:
  metadata:
    writeStrategy:
      type: "UPSERT_BY_AND_TIMESTAMP"
      key: [id]
      timestamp: signup
  name: "customers"
  pattern: "customers.*.psv"
  attributes:
  - ...
```
