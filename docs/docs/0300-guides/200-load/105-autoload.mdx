# Autoload


:::note
Datawarehouses are organized around schemas where tables are grouped.
Depending on the database, a database `schema` can be called `schema` or `catalog` or `dataset`.
In starlake, we use the term `domain` to designate  a `schema`, `catalog` or `dataset`.
:::

The conventions used by the autoload command are:
- files are stored under the incoming directory and named after the domain and table they are loaded into: `$SL_ROOT/incoming/<domain>/<table><suffix>.<extension>`
- The target schema is named after the domain names
- The target tables are named after the file name without the extension or suffix.
- The suffix is used to differentiate betwwen files that are loaded in full `overwrite` mode and those loaded in `append` mode.
For example `order_20240228.json` and `order_line_20240228.csv` are respectively loaded into the same table `order` and `order_line`.

```plaintext title="directory structure example before running autoload"
incoming
└── starbake
    ├── product.xml
    ├── order_20240228.csv
    └── order_line_20240228.csv
metadata/load
```
<br/>

After running the `autoload`command:
```plaintext title="table schemas inferred from the directory structure"
incoming
└── starbake
    ├── product.xml
    ├── order_20240228.csv
    └── order_line_20240228.csv
metadata/load
└── starbake
    ├── _config.sl.yml
    ├── product.sl.yml
    └── order.sl.yml
```
<br/>



- The `_config.sl.yml` file is a configuration file that contains the domain configuration and describe how the domain will be created in the target database.

- The `<table>.sl.yml` file contains the table configuration and describes how files are parsed, validated and loaded into the target database.


## How autoload detects the format of the files

- It expects the file to be named after the table it will be loaded into.
- It uses the file extension to detect the format of the file. The supported formats are `csv`,`psv`,`dsv`, `json`, `xml`
- It uses the first line of the file to detect the separator and the number of columns.
- In the case of CSV files, it uses the first line of the file to detect the column names.
- It uses the whole file content to detect the column types.
- In the case of JSON file, if is a considered a JSON_ARRAY file if the first character is `[` and a JSON file if the first character is `{`.
- In the case of XML file, it uses the first line of the file to detect the root element and the number of columns.

XML files are expected to have the following structure:
<br/>

```xml
<?xml> # optional xml declaration
<root>
    <row attr1="value1" >
        <column1>value1</column1>
        <column2>value2</column2>
        ...
    </row>
<root>

```
