# The load directory

## Directory structure
Datawarehouses are organized around schemas where tables are grouped.
Depending on the database, a database `schema` can be called `schema` or `catalog` or `dataset`.
In starlake, we use the term `domain` to designate  a `schema`, `catalog` or `dataset`.

Below is a typical structure of the `load` section of a starlake project.

It allows to load files to the `product` and `order` tables in the `sales` domain
and the `seller` and `location` tables in the `hr` domain.

<br/>

```plaintext
metadata/load
├── sales
│   ├── _config.sl.yml
│   ├── product.sl.yml
│   └── order.sl.yml
└── hr
    ├── seller.sl.yml
    └── location.sl.yml
```
<br/>

- The `_config.sl.yml` file is a configuration file that contains the domain configuration and describe how the domain will be created in the target database.

- The `<table-name>.sl.yml` file contain the table configuration and describe how files are parsed, validated and loaded into the target database.


## Domain configuration

We first need to define where the CSV files will be loaded from.
This is done by creating a domain configuration file that describe where the `load` command should look for the files to load

<br/>

In this case the load command will look in the directory `{{incoming_path}}/starbake` where `{{incoming_path}}` is an environment variable
defined in the `metadata/env.sl.yml` file and that may be redefined for each environment (dev, test, prod) in the `metadata/env.dev.yml` file for example.

<br/>

```yaml title="metadata/load/<domain>/_config.sl.yml"
load:
  metadata:
    directory: "{{incoming_path}}/starbake"
```
<br/>

Since the directory is set at the domain level, this means that all files loaded for this domain, will be loaded from this directory.
