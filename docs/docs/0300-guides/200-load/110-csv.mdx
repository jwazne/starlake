# Load DSV files

## Domain configuration

We first need to define where the CSV files will be loaded from.
This is done by creating a domain configuration file that describe where the `load` command should look for the files to load

<br/>

In this case the load command will look in the directory `{{incoming_path}}/starbake` where `{{incoming_path}}` is an environment variable
 defined in the `metadata/env.sl.yml` file and that may be redefined for each environment (dev, test, prod) in the `metadata/env.dev.yml` file for example.

<br/>

```yaml title="metadata/load/<domain>/_config.sl.yml"
load:
  metadata:
    directory: "{{incoming_path}}/starbake"
```
<br/>

Since the directory is set at the domain level, this means that all files loaded for this domain, will be loaded from this directory.


## File load configuration

Most of the time, we won't need to define the table configuration, as the `infer-schema` command will be able to infer the table configuration from the file itself using the `infer-schema command.

Sometimes, we still need to update some properties of the load configuration for the table or add new properties not present in the source file (ACL, comments  ...) or apply transformations.

<br/>

Describing the file you load involves defining :
- the file pattern that is mapped to this schema,
- the parsing parameters and the materialization strategy (APPEND, OVERWRITE, OVERWRITE_BY_PARTITION, UPSERT_BY_KEY, UPSERT_BY_KEY_AND_TIMESTAMP, SCD2 ...)
- the file format as a list of attributes.

<br/>

The name property of the column is the only required field. The type property is optional and will be set to `string` if not provided.
The configuration file below describes how the order line files should be loaded.


<br/>

```yaml title="metadata/load/<domain>/<table>.sl.yml"
table:
  pattern: "order_line.*.csv"
  metadata:
    format: "DSV"
    withHeader: true
    separator: ";"
    writeStrategy:
      type: "APPEND"
  attributes:
  - name: "order_id"
    type: "int"
  - name: "product_id"
    type: "int"
  - name: "quantity"
    type: "int"
  - name: "sale_price"
    type: "double"
```



## File Parsing

Parsing options are defined in the `metadata` section of the configuration file.
- `encoding` : the encoding of the file. Default is `UTF-8`
- `withHeader` : if the file contains a header. Default is `true`
- `separator` : the separator used in the file. Default is `;`
- `quote` : the quote character used in the file. Default is `"`
- `escape` : the escape character used in the file. Default is `\`
- `ignore` : a regex to filter lines to ignore. All lines matching the regex will be ignored. Default is None
- `ack` : load file only if a file with the same name and with this extension exist in the same directory.
- `options` : a map of options to pass to the parser. Available options are defined in the [Apache Spark CSV documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-csv.html#data-source-option)
- `emptyIsNull` : if empty column values should be considered as null. Default is `false`
- `fillWithDefaultValue` : if the null value should be filled with the default value of the column. Default is `false`

## Attributes validation

The attributes properties are defined in the `attributes` section of the configuration file.
- `name` : the name of the column in the file header. If no header is present, this refers to the column index in the file. This is the only required property. this will also refer to the column name in the table except if the `rename` property is set.
- `type` : the type of the column. Default is `string`.
Available types are `string`, `int`, `long`, `double`, `float`, `boolean`,
any flavor of `date` or `timestamp` as defined in the `metadata/types/default.sl.yml` file. Also note that you can add your own types in the `metadata/types` directory.
- `required` : if the column is required to have a non null value (see `nullValue` in the `metadata.options` section). Default is `false`
- `privacy` :  a transformation to apply to the column. Default is `None`
- `transform` : a transformation to apply to the column. Default is `None`
- `comment` : a comment for the column. Default is `None`
- `rename` : the name of the column in the database. Default to the `name` property value.
- `default` : the default value of the column. Default is `None`
- `trim` : the trim strategy for the column. Default is `None`. Available trim strategies are `None`, `Left`, `Right`, `Both`

To add / replace or ignore some attributes, check the [Transform on load](transform) section.
