# Secure access to your tables



## Table Level Security
Security on a table is defined by the ACL section of the table definition. The ACL section defines the role and the grants for the role. The role is the permission that is granted to the grants. The grants can be users, groups or service accounts.

Below is an example of the ACL section of a table definition.


import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';


<Tabs>

<TabItem value="bigquery" label="BigQuery">

BigQuery Example
````yaml
acl:
  role: role/bigQueryViewer
  grants:
    - user:user@starlake.ai
    - group:goup@starlake.ai
    - serviceAccount:service@gserviceaccount.google.com
````
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="spark" label="Spark">

````yaml
acl:
role: SELECT
grants:
- user@starlake.ai
- group
````
</TabItem>

</Tabs>


## Row Level Security

You may also want to restrict access to specific rows in a table.
This is done by defining a row level security policy.
The policy is defined by a SQL expression that is evaluated for each row in the table.
If the expression evaluates to true, the row is returned. If the expression evaluates to false, the row is not returned.

Below is an example of a row level security policy.

```yaml
    rls:
      - name: "USA only"
        predicate: "country = 'USA'"
        grants:
          - "group:mygroup"
```


## Column Level Security
