# Transform configuration

:::note
Datawarehouses are organized around schemas where tables are grouped.
Depending on the database, a database `schema` can be called `schema` or `catalog` or `dataset`.
In starlake, we use the term `domain` to designate  a `schema`, `catalog` or `dataset`.
:::

Exactly like in the `load` section, the `transform` section is organized around the `domain` and `table` concepts.

Transforming data consists in applying a series of operations to the data to make it ready for analysis.
The operations can be as simple as renaming a column or as complex as joining multiple tables together.

The transform takes queries or python scripts as input and outputs to a existing or new table using a write strategy.

The way the materialization is done is defined in a YAML file next to the SQL or Python file.
The YAML file and the SQL file are named, by default, after the table they are transforming .

The transform directory looks like this:
```plaintext title="transform directory structure"
metadata/transform
└── <domain>>
    ├── _config.sl.yml
    ├── <table>.sl.yml
    └── <table>.sql
```
<br/>

The SQL file contains only the SELECT statement that contain the transformations to apply before storing on the target table.

And the YAML file contains the configuration of the transformation. The sections below describe the content of the YAML file.

## Write strategy configuration

If not specified, the result of the `SELECT`statement contained in the SQL file will be appended to the `<table>` located in `<domain>`.
You may use any of these strategies. Below is an example of using the `overwrite` strategy.

```yaml
