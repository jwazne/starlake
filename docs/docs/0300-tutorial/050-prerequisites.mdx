# Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, please make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Java 11+: [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
- duckdb (optional): [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation)

Instead of DuckDB, you can use any other database that you have access to.
We will use DuckDB in this tutorial because it is a simple, lightweight, in-memory database that is easy to install and use.


# Getting Started

In this tutorial,
- we will use the Starlake CLI to create a new project,
- extract data from a database and then load the data into your favorite datawarehouse.
- Run transformations from the command line and from Airflow
- Generate the documentation for the project

We will use the Starbake project, a simple Github project that allows us to create fake data inside a database for our tutorial.
