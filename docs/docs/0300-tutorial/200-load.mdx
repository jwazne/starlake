# Load

Load and validate, in one shot or incrementally, JSON, XML and CSV files into your datawarehouse using different write strategies.

## Prerequisites
This step assumes we loaded we have the data located in the incoming folder as described in the [Extract](../extract/README.md) step.

If you skipped the extract step above, you can download the data from [here](https://github.com/starlake-ai/starlake/tree/master/samples/starbake/incoming/starbake).
and copy them to the incoming/starbake folder.
The folder conatins now three files:
- products.xml
- orders_20240228.json
- order_lines_20240228.csv

## Infer schema
The only step is to infer the schema of the incoming files. This is done by running the following command:

```bash
starlake infer-schema --input-path incoming/starbake --clean
```

Your metadata `load` folder should now contain the folder `starbake` with following files:
- products.sl.yml
- orders.sl.yml
- order_lines.yml

The Ã¬nfer-schema` command has created a schema file for each of the files in the incoming folder trying to detect the schema of the files.
These schema files are used to load the data into the datawarehouse.

## Load data into your datawarehouse

To load the data, we need to infer the schema of each of the file.

Run the following command to infer the schema of the files in the incoming folder.

```bash

starlake load

```

This will create a schema file for each of the files in the incoming folder.


## Load files into your datawarehouse
Now that we have a schema for each of the file in the incoming folder, we can load them into our datawarehouse.

The datawarehouse can be a local file, a database or a cloud storage. By default, your files will be loaded into a local file in delta format.

to load it to a different datawarehouse, you can specify a different connectionRef in the application.sl.yml file.

```yaml
load:
  connectionRef: "your-connection-ref"
```

To load the data, run the following command.

```bash

starlake load --input-path incoming/starbake --schema-path incoming/starbake-schema --output-path incoming/starbake-tables

```
