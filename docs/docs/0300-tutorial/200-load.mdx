# Load

Load and validate, in one shot or incrementally, JSON, XML and CSV files into your datawarehouse using different write strategies.

## Prerequisites
This step assumes we loaded we have the data located in the incoming folder as described in the [Extract](../extract/README.md) step.
If you skipped the extract step, you can download the data from [here]()


## Infer schema
The only step is to infer the schema of the incoming files. This is done by running the following command:

```bash

starlake infer-schema --input-path /path/to/incoming/folder --clean

```
